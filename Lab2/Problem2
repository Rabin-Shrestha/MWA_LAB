Qno1: Why do we want sometime to use setImmediate instead of setTimeOut ?
=>
setImmediate() is to schedule the immediate execution of callback after I/O
events callbacks finished and before setTimeout and setInterval. However
setTimeout() is  like calling the function after some delay.SetTimeout() function is  queued so
that it is executed after all the executing and currently queued event handlers are
finished first.
Even (setTimeout,0) will be slower than setImmediate because it will check the timer at least once before executing.
so in many case we prefer SetImmediate() to execute the function Immediately after current I/O callback finished
which will be faster than setTimeout().


Qno2: Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
 ==>
 Any callbacks assigned by process.nextTick() is queued in the nextTickQueue
 and the event loop executes them one after another another, till the entire
 queue is drained out; after completing the ongoing operation; irrespective
 of which phase it is in. However setImmediate() is not exactly immediate, but the queue containing the callbacks
 of this, will be executed once in every iteration ie when event loop is in Check phase.
